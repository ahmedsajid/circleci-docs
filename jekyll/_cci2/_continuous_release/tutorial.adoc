What we'll cover in this tutorial.

== Prerequisites

=== Tools

* Docker, Hyperkit, or other virtual machine manager
* minikube
* kubectl

==== Virtual machine manager

Before you can use minikube, you will need to install a virtual machine manager, such as https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community&sort=updated_at&order=desc[Docker]. For more information on virtual machine managers, https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[see the minikube guide].

==== minikube

Minikube allows you to quickly set up a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, or Windows. It is designed to help you learn, develop, and test your applications.

To download minikube, follow the https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[installation guide].

==== kubectl

Kubectl is the Kubernetes command-line tool. It allows you to run commands on Kubernetes clusters. To download kubectl, follow the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[instructions on the installation guide]. Alternatively, if you have Homebrew installed, type `brew install kubectl` at the CLI.

=== Knowledge

* Basic understanding of Kubernetes
* Familiarity with using the CLI
